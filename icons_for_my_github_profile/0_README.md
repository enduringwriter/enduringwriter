<!--- About the icons -->
<body>
    <p align="left">
        Enduring Writer and Sing Fighter icons are trademarks from Keith Stateson.
        <br><br>
        LinkedIn, Pycharm, Visual Studio Code, and Photoshop icons were downloaded from their respective company website. The other icons are from GitHub Tabler or directly from the company's website.
        <br><br>
        Some icons in this "icons" folder have been edited using Adobe iOS software.
        <br><br>
        Icons are being used in accordance with each company's branding guidelines, and for educational use as I am a Data Science student at Codeup.
